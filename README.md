# Boilerplate With Webpack, ES6, and SCSS For Frontend Websites

Also with [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/), [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), [filename hashing](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin#long-term-caching), [source maps](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/), [babel](https://babeljs.io/) (for ES6) and [automatic filled in filenames](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) of the `css` and `js`-files in your _HTML_-page.

## Webpack Is A Bitch To Setup
It is, but I recommend going through their guides, because they are very good at the moment. Go to [webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started) and browse through the sidebar from top to bottom and you will learn a lot! It's worth your time.

## Philosophy Of This Boilerplate
This packages does not everything for you, but it is a strong basis for when you want to use ES6 and SCSS. It adds a few things that are used most of the times, like [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and [filename hashing](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin#long-term-caching). But not much more than that.

## Recourses
Most of this comes from two recourses. The first [Webpack Guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides), again, they are really good and you should check them out.

Next is this awesome guide _A tale of Webpack 4 and how to finally configure it in the right way_ writen by Margarita Obraztsova ([instagram](https://www.instagram.com/riittagirl), [twitter](https://twitter.com/riittagirl)) on [hackernoon.com](https://hackernoon.com/a-tale-of-webpack-4-and-how-to-finally-configure-it-in-the-right-way-4e94c8e7e5c1)
